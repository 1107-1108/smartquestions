# How to ask questions Smartly

## Introduction

This wiki is written for dealing with "When you ask a question, can you get useful answers". This always ==depends on the way you ask==, and does it make you look like an idiot.

##Before you ask

> Try to search online
>
> Try to read the official wiki
>
> Try to read the booklet
>
> Try to check yourself
>
> Try to read the code
>
> Try to read the errors

Before you ask questions, please try these ways. This will express your personality that you don't want to waste other's time.

Get ready with your answer, ==**simple but in detail**==. Or the answer you will get will only be useless and stupid.

==**Don't consider you can get the perfect and final answer from anywhere**==.

## Questions Format

**==Error in detail + What have you done==**

For instance, as you find your computer die with a blue screen, **==you should write down the error code==**, or take a picture. Don't shout "Ahhhhh my funny computer die!".

Also, please **==try your best to understand the answer others give you==**.
